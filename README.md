# ATtiny85_morse_code_identifier
Unattended amateur radio fox hunt hidden station identifier

This program is used to control a Baofeng UV-5R VHF/UHF handheld transceiver.

Fox hunt consists of low power UHF hidden transmitter. This software was written to run on an AVR ATtiny85 microcontroller. The ATtiny85 is connected to the Baofeng transceiver through electronic circuit into the microphone jack. It randomly transmits a morse code identification signal. Fox hunt participants then attempt to locate the hidden transmitter using radio direction finding techniques.
